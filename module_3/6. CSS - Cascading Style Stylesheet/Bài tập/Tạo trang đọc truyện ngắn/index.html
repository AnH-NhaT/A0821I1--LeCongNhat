                <h3>Chapter 1:</h3>
                <p>Vietnam (Vietnamese: Việt Nam, [vîət nāːm] (About this soundlisten)), officially the Socialist
                    Republic of Vietnam,[n 3] is a country in Southeast Asia. Located at the eastern edge of mainland
                    Southeast Asia, it covers 311,699 square kilometres. With a population of over 96 million, it is the
                    world's fifteenth-most populous country. Vietnam borders China to the north, Laos and Cambodia to
                    the west, and shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the
                    Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its
                    largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.[n 4]

                    Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The first known Vietnamese nation during the
                    first millennium BC centred on the Red River Delta, located in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han
                    dynasty annexed and put the Vietnamese under Chinese rule from 111 BC, until the first independent
                    dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through
                    Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta. The Nguyễn—the last imperial
                    dynasty—fell to French colonisation in 1887. Following the August Revolution, the nationalist Viet
                    Minh under the leadership of communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh proclaimed independence from France
                    in 1945.Vietnam (Vietnamese: Việt Nam, [vîət nāːm] (About this soundlisten)), officially the
